=============
* Add functions for reading 16-bits (unsigned short) from memory
* Add functions for writing 16-bits (unsigned short) to memory
* Implement a class called bus_t to act as a bus between different emulated
  hardware components.
* Implement a class called chip_t which uses the bus to read opcodes from
  memory_t and sends them to cpu_t to be executed.
