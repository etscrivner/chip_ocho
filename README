ChipOcho - A simple CHIP-8 emulator which can be compiled on Mac OS X, Windows
and Linux.

Goal: To create a simple CHIP-8 emulator which can load and execute CHIP-8 ROMs.

Compiling
----------
To compile ChipOcho merely download the source code in the command-line type
'make all', a successful build looks something like this:

  $ make all
	.
	.
	.
	Compilation complete, executable file is './chip_ocho'
	
If successful this command will output an executable in the same directory as
the Makefile called 'chip_ocho'.

Compiling Unit Tests
---------------------

If you would like to also compile to the unit tests for ChipOcho you can type
'make tests' in the command-line, a successful build looks something like this:

	$ make tests
	.
	.
	.
	Compiling tests complete, executable file is './chip_ocho_tests'
	
If successful this command will output an executable in the same directory as
the Makefile called 'chip_ocho_tests'.
